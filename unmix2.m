function [P] = unmix2(data, endmemberMean)
% This function performs NCM-QP unmixing (Normal Compositional Model, Quadratic Programming approach).
% INPUTS 
%  data - double Mat - DxN matrix of image data.
%  endmemberMean - double Mat - DxM matrix of endmember mean value (known).
% OUTPUTS
%   P - double Mat - MxN matrix of abundances/proportions corresponding to N input
%       pixels and M endmembers
