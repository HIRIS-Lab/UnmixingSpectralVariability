This package contains programs that have been written by O. ECHES, N. DOBIGEON and J.-Y. TOURNERET, for the
implementation of the hyperspectral linear unmixing procedure for the Normal Compositional Model. For more details:

O. Eches, N. Dobigeon, C. Mailhes and J.-Y. Tourneret, "Unmixing hyperspectral images 
using a Normal Compositional Model and MCMC methods," in Proc. IEEE Workshop on Statistical 
Signal Processing (SSP), Cardiff, Wales, UK, to appear.

The main function is "unmixing.m".
You can edit this file to understand the structure of the procedure based on a hierarchical model
and a Gibbs sampling strategy.
The programs are written in MATLAB code.
You will find in "example_unmixing.m" a code which allows you 
to perform the unmixing procedure on a synthetic pixel with parameters you can freely define.
