% SYNTAX : [P] = BCM(Xim, Parameters, MethodFlag)
%
% INPUTS:
%     Xim - double Mat - N1xN2xD matrix of N1xN2 image data points of dimensionality D 
%           (i.e.  N=N1xN2 pixels with D spectral bands).
%           Note that BCM only takes in input data between 0 and 1!
%   endmembers - double Mat - known endmember samples (provided)
%   Parameters - struct - The struct contains the following fields:
%               % These parameters are user defined (can be modified)
%                   1. NumberIterations: Number of iterations
%                   2. K: Number of nearest neighbors
%                   3. c: Number of clusters for spatial K-means
%                   4. SigV: Weighting on SigmaV
%                   5. SigM: Weighting on SigmaMean
%                   6. s: Scaling parameter for location information
%                   7. ECovariance: diagonal covariance on endmembers, currently same for all endmembers
%               % These parameters are computed from input data and known
%               endmembers (does not need modification)
%                   8. MaxNumEMs/M: Number of endmembers
%                   9. bandnum/D: Number of spectral bands/dimensions
%                  10. N: Number of pixels(input data points)
%                  11. Emean: Mean of endmember samples
%                  12. BetaParameters: parameters for fitting a Beta distribution to each band of each endmember
%               *Parameters can be modified in [Parameters] = BCMParameters(endmembers) function.
%   MethodFlag - double Mat - 1x1 integer, choose from 1, 2, 3, 4, where each number indicates one BCM approach:
%                       MethodFlag==1 => BCM-Spectral-QP (BCM-Spectral unmixing: Quadratic Programming approach)
%                       MethodFlag==2 => BCM-Spectral-MH (BCM-Spectral unmixing: Metropolis-Hastings Sampling approach)
%                       MethodFlag==3 => BCM-Spatial-QP  (BCM-Spatial unmixing: Quadratic Programming approach)
%                       MethodFlag==4 => BCM-Spatial-MH  (BCM-Spatial unmixing: Metropolis-Hastings Sampling approach)
% OUTPUTS:
%   P - double Mat - NxM matrix of abundances/proportions corresponding to N input
%       pixels and M endmembers
% OTHER m-FILES REQUIRED: 
%   unmix_qpas_correct.m, BCM_Spectral.m, BCM_Spatial.m, BCMParameters.m,     
%   Matlab Statistics Toolbox, Matlab Optimization Toolbox
