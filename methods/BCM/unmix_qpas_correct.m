function [P2] = unmix_qpas_correct(data, endmembers,methodFlag)
% This function performs quadratic unmixing given endmember mean values
% SYNTAX : [P2] = unmix_qpas_correct(data, endmembers)
% INPUTS 
%     data - double Mat - DxN matrix of N data points of dimensionality D 
%         (i.e.  N pixels with D spectral bands, each pixel is a column vector).
%     endmembers - double Mat - DxM matrix of M endmembers (endmember mean spectra) of dimensionality D.
%     methodFlag - double Mat - 1x1 integer. 
%               If methodFlag == 1, BCM Spectral QP unmixing;
%               If methodFlag == 3, BCM Spatial QP unmixing.
% OUTPUTS
%     P2 - double Mat - NxM matrix of abundances/proportions corresponding to N input
%         pixels and M endmembers
