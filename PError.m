function [PErrorOutput, PErrorOutputmean, PErrorOutputvar] = PError(N,Ptrue,Pestimate)

% This function computes the proportion erros per pixel per endmember 
%       given true and estimated proportion values.
%
% SYNTAX : [PErrorOutput, PErrorOutputmean, PErrorOutputvar] = PError(N,Ptrue,Pestimate)
%
% INPUTS 
%     N:             Total number of data points. N=N1*N2 in hyperspectral
%                    image data.
%     Ptrue:         True proportion values. N*M, where M is the number of
%                    endmembers.
%     Pestimate:     Estimated proportion values. N*M.
% OUTPUTS
%     PErrorOutput:       PError per pixel
%     PErrorOutputmean:   Mean of PErrorOutput, PError per pixel per
%                         endmember. (This is the result in the Tables in the paper)
%     PErrorOutputvar:    Variance of PErrorOutput across endmembers.
