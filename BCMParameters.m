function [Parameters] = BCMParameters(endmembers)

%   This function sets the parameters to be used during the BCM unmixing algorithm
%
% INPUT
%   endmembers - cell - 1xM cell of endmember samples (known) where M is the number of endmembers.
%               DxNumESamples double matrix within each cell, where D is the
%               number of spectral bands and NumESamples is the number of
%               endmember samples
% OUTPUT
%   Parameters - struct - The struct contains the following fields:
%               % These parameters are user defined (can be modified)
%                   1. NumberIterations: Number of iterations
%                   2. K: Number of nearest neighbors
%                   3. c: Number of clusters for spatial K-means
%                   4. SigV: Weighting on SigmaV
%                   5. SigM: Weighting on SigmaMean
%                   6. s: Scaling parameter for location information
%                   7. ECovariance: diagonal covariance on endmembers, currently same for all endmembers
%               % These parameters are computed from input data and known
%               endmembers (does not need modification)
%                   8. MaxNumEMs/M: Number of endmembers
%                   9. bandnum/D: Number of spectral bands/dimensions
%                  10. N: Number of pixels(input data points)
%                  11. Emean: Mean of endmember samples
%                  12. BetaParameters: parameters for fitting a Beta distribution to each band of each endmember
